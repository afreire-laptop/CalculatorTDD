Feature: Addition
As a user
I want to have an Add endpoint
So that I could add two numbers

Scenario 1: Happy flow
When user sends a get request to /add endpoint
And query parameters 'a=x' and 'b=y' where x and y are both integers
Then user should receive a response 200 with x+y as a content

Scenario 2: Edge Case 1
When user send a get request to /add endpoint
And query parameters are not an integer values
Then user should receive a response 400 - Bad Request
And content should be "'<parameter>' has invalid value '<value>'"
